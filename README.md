# ECS 111 Emotion Detection in Children's Drawings Project

This repository will contain all the code that is used for the project, from smaller tasks such as normalization, resizing, etc. to the final algorithm that is built for emotion detection. The main goal of this project is to properly and accurately identify the emotion present in children's drawings.

Project Proposal: 
[Proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mfopRWyw--y7h06VD_z1D53k16H_82CRohDGWVvjiAk/edit?usp=sharing)

Dataset: 
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishmiperera/children-drawings?select=data)

Task Plan: 
- Week 7:
  - resizing + normalizing (sadia)
  - conversion of file types to 1 type + division of testing and training data (jes)
  - data encoding for the emotions + figure out algorithm to use (research & share with group on findings/algorithms to go for) (chuck)
  - extra:
    - technically everyone can do research on the algorithm :))
    - if tasks are done early and we have an algorithm in mind, we can start building our algorithm!

- Week 8 + Onwards:
  - building algorithm and testing (hopefully have complete by end of the week),
  - extra:
    - start working on presentation + final paper
